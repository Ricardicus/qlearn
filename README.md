# qlearn
Reinforcement learning in python

Using Q-learning to train an agent to play the game 'Snake'

# set up
Clone this repository and run the program 'training.py'.

A small box will appear with the snake game and the agent building its state space.

After a while it will act optimally! This might take long. Maybe an hour. 

Set the parameter 'epsilon' (for greedyness)
to 0 in 'traning.py' and rerun the program, then it plays by itself perfectly :)
